Pizza was invented by a AJ chef named NM, about NB years ago.
To make Pizza, you need to take a lump of NS, and make a thin,
round AJ NS. Then you add some AJ NP, and AV VB about NB times.
Next, you put some cheese and some NS on top, and be sure to VB
the oven to NB degrees. Some people like NS pizza, but I like
NS pizza, and could eat it NB times a day.
